  body: `They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and one 12-year-old girl in Fairfax, VA, is learning that lesson the hard way. According to the [*Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2016/02/27/a-12-year-old-girl-is-facing-criminal-charges-for-using-emoji-shes-not-alone/?tid=sm_fb), a student at Sidney Lanier Middle School admitted to authorities that she was the one who posted an emoji-filled Instagram message that worried some students and teachers. It read in part:

Killing 🔫

“meet me in the library Tuesday”

🔫 🔪 💣

After a police investigation led to her, the girl is now facing criminal charges. Besides the fact that she admitted to posting it under another student’s name (enter, computer harassment charges), they also charged her with threatening the school, although a spokesman for the district said it was ultimately deemed “not credible.”

But these days, we all know any kind of potential threat is not taken lightly — even when it comes with cartoon symbols. In fact, the courts have been seeing an increase in cases that involve emojis. For example, one NYC teen was [charged](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/grand-jury-tosses-brooklyn-teen-emoji-threat-charges-article-1.2101735) with making a terrorist threat last year after putting a police officer emoji next to three gun emojis. Charges were dropped after a grand jury failed to indict, but there’s a big conversation happening right now in the legal world over the use of these little images and how they should be interpreted, especially when it comes to threats.

The Fairfax girl’s mom told the *Post* that her daughter has never been in trouble before and that she had posted this message and others in question in response to being bullied at school. But ultimately it’s up to a grand jury to decide her fate.

For a typical evening out, we beauty buffs tend to take our makeup game pretty seriously. We’re talking an intricate smoky eye, a killer contour, maybe even a bold lip — you know, the works. Albeit, we’d be lying if we acted like that’s how it goes 100% of the time. Sometimes a girl (or boy!) just can’t be bothered with the whole nine yards — especially after a day spent in a blissful Netflix-couch-coma. On nights like these, we shoot for a more low-key glam that we could also break out for daytime — something that says, “I totally put effort into this, but I also whipped it up in no time.” Don’t think it’s possible to have both? Allow our lovely influencer, [Sazan Hendrix](https://instagram.com/sazanhendrix/), to show you how it’s done.

In this lightning-fast tutorial, which she partnered with Dior to bring us, Sazan walks us through how to achieve her flawless-and-flirty makeup in a flash. Besides being crazy-easy, this look is ideal for any occasion — day or night. Watch her 1-minute vid and read on for a more detailed breakdown.


__Step One: Ace Your Base__
To create an even canvas that appears dewy and fresh, Sazan goes in with a light layer of the [Diorskin Airflash Foundation](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/296925158;124127457;p) and then uses a kabuki brush to target any areas that need a hint more coverage. “I personally love having the brush to blend everything in nice and evenly — no streaks attached,” she says. The finished look is airbrushed, but also natural-looking, which should always be your aim!

__Step Two: Up Your Flush__
For a rosy flush that amps the flirty-ness, Sazan carefully sweeps on [Dior’s Rosy Glow blush](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/296925838;124127655;u), which instantly brings her complexion to life. Quick tip: When using any cheek product, be sure to apply with a light hand to avoid looking cake-y or clown-like.

__Step Three: Shadow Play__
For the eyes, Sazan keeps things super simple with a pop of subtle shimmer on the lid and some definition on her lower lash line. You can use [Dior’s Eye Reviver](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/296929983;124128751;x) — a gorgeous neutrals palette — to achieve what she did here.

__Step Four: Just a Coat__
To keep the main focus on her radiant skin, Sazan only applies a touch of mascara to her naturally long lashes. The result is fluttery and feminine, which we’re most definitely digging.

__Step Five: Perfect Your Pout__
For the final step in her speedy regime, Sazan swipes on a generous layer of Dior’s infamous [Lip Glow](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/296925904;124128018;i), which leaves behind a your-lips-but-plumper-and-pinker effect. “It’s basically a soft pink lip balm and primer all in one,” she says. “It’s also great for putting over your favorite lipstick shade.”
